/**
 * Problem 5
 *
 * As a user, I want to see multiple farms (with different strawberry varieties)
 * and their harvested yields, so I can quickly understand the overall harvest data.
 *
 * You only have 45 minutes.
 * Focus on data representation over interactivity.
 * No interactivity is required, just a presentation of the mockData.
 *
 * Feel free to complete this task however you are most comfortable.
 *
 * Instructions:
 * 1. Display the data from `mockData.js` in any format you like (table, cards, graph, etc.).
 * 2. Provide a basic summary or insight (e.g. total yields, yields by variety, or similar).
 * 3. Optionally use Tailwind for styling (if implementing in code).
 * 4. Be prepared to discuss your approach.
